# CurrencyExchangeCal

# How It Works 
Based on the level on permission available via exchange api, 
the based exchange currency is made static and with a dynamic 
latest list of other currencies made available by the endpoints,
that is EUR to other currencies but also USR is make default for
first time user. 
For first time user, the app solely depends on internet to get 
the list of currencies exchange rate. 
Thanks
